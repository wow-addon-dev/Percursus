*Master every course. Beat your time.*

Percursus is an addon that displays a live timer during a race (e.g. dragonriding & skyriding) and provides a detailed time overview of all completed races.

This addon is compatible with all race types such as dragonriding, skyriding, skyrocketing and breakneck (D.R.I.V.E.).

The following key features are currently implemented:
*   Race Tracker: During the race, an overlay is shown that allows you to track your current race time
*   Race Time Overview: Next to the quest window of each Bronze Timekeeper, your current race times, as well as the gold and silver medal times are shown

### Features

*   Three modes for the 'Race Tracker' are currently available: current race time, countdown to medal time (gold or silver) and countdown to personal best time
*   Different backgrounds can be selected for the 'Race Tracker' (optional)
*   The current race speed (gliding speed) can be displayed during the race (this only works with dragonriding and skyriding)
*   The position of the 'Race Tracker' can be moved and positioned according to your own preferences
*   All race times of the current zone can be viewed in the 'Race Time Overview' (optional)
*   Both key features can be activated or deactivated separately
*   Supported languages: English, German, Russian

Further customisation options for the 'Race Tracker' are planned.
